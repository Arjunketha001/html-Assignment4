Accessibility in web development means making websites and web applications usable 
for as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

It's essential to create accessible websites because it ensures all users, 
regardless of their abilities, have equal access to information and functionality.

It benefits different user groups by providing them with the ability to interact, navigate, 
and contribute to the web.

Accessible design often leads to improved user experiences for everyone, including clear
navigation and content structure.
